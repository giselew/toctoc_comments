	* CSS-files can be frozen (no checks for needed changes and regeneration if needed): see TS-Setup-Option theme.freezeLevelCSS
	* Added 2 fluid ViewHelper for extension news. With this, news integrates toctoc_comments like tt_news does, features like comments counter in the news list can be setup in news as well
	* included entire sharing possibilities from sharrre by adding Pinterest, Digg and Delicious
	* Used form fields are defined now by TS-option useFields (title, firstname, location, homepage, gender), now the template is totally dynamic
	* TS-option useGenderWithField (lastname) fixes where the gender-selection pictures are placed 
	* For form fields there are now subtemplates for hidden input, visible field and gender
	* Now lastname and e-mail are mandatory
	* New form field comment title
	* Subcomments have their own template now
	* fixed a bug which is rather complicated to explain: UC panels on top of the plugin show wrong user when users are present as likers and dislikers, 
	  the first uc is ok, but the uc at the same position on the other side (dislikes) showed the same user again
	* In environments running extensions vhs, fluidpages and flux: page caching is "no longer available by some reason"
	  Set vmcNoPageCache = 1 to avoid errors when accessing page cache fails (make an iLike, see an error with getKey? that's it)
	* Table tx_toctoc_comments_prefixtotable is no longer maintained as static table, importing data twice did destabilize the plugin. But initial data still can be imported:
	  it's recommended, for fresh installations, that you set Extension option importDataprefixtotable = 1. This imports the initial data which before was maintained as static table data
	  When you start a plugin in frontend the initial data will be imported. After this set importDataprefixtotable again to 0 to avoid unneeded database access
	* fixed problems with sharing links in design 0 and 2 (small buttons did not work)
	* Changed name of function .modal to .txtcmoddlg in library jQuery.simplemodal to avoid conflicts with other jQuery-libraries (Twitter Bootstrap), renamed js-file to jquery.txtc-simplemodal.1.4.3.min.js
	* Changed names of two functions in library jQuery.tools to avoid conflicts with other jQuery-libraries (Twitter Bootstrap), .tooltip is now .cooltip and .overlay is .superpose
	  Left filename intact, but a rename to jquery.tctx-tools.min.js is recommended to keep order
	* jquery.tools.min.js is optimized in size by eliminating unneeded tools-functions
	* When a user picture or an avatar picture cannot be found on your server, by whatever reason, an image from toctoc.ch is displayed. It's a text in courier new, black on white: "image not found"
	* JavaScript files are minified now, resulting in 40% reduction of the concerned files size. Uncompressed versions are available in zip-file js.uncompressed.zip
	
2014-02-26  Gisèle Wendl  <gisele.wendl@toctoc.ch>
	* Release of version 5.0.1
	* Fixed JavaScript bug "After edit and save comment, the save comment event is not rebound"
	* Deleted smilie "frown = :[" from setup.txt. It interacted with BB-Codes
	* Fixed JavaScript error for AJAX page part refreshs after logins/logouts: "ids on tags that appear in first place in the HTML were not refreshed"
	* Fixed JavaScript bug "Fill comment with several lines, then <delete> all of them: No resize happens"
	* Made regular language files for the backend module (compatibility TYPO3-language-server)
	* Fixed JavaScript bug "Entering comment title and pressing enter, like for form submit, submits the form to page"
	* Added TS-Option theme.boxmodelLineHeightPreserve for the CSS-line height: Preserve original line-height, it saves some lines of CSS, but results with ratingstars and ilike thumbs can be out of measure. 

2014-05-01  Gisèle Wendl  <gisele.wendl@toctoc.ch>
	* Release of version 5.1.0
	* Please change to the new template, it changed a little because of improvements in HTML-quality and support for $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['versionNumberInFilename'].
	* CSS: Fixed calculation for top-margin of ratingstars and like-button with new entries in boxmodell_system.txt
	* CSS: added some @media-instructions to assume responsive behaviours of word-breaks, placings of comments and different look for login form
	* Added TS-Option theme.responsiveSteps (pixel). These are the screen-widths when layouting in toctoc_comments can change.
	  The two available steps concern the word-breaks and placing of comments and indented element.
	  The option can be adjusted by page, thus allowing very nice control over the responsive behaviour inside the plugin. 
	* Added TS-Option advanced.autoConvertLinksCropLength, cropping autoconverted links to a reasonable length (40 - 150)
	* Fixed PHP-code bug "some servers did output the HTML of the AJAX-Login-Standaloneplugin with an erroneous /div> at the end"
	* PHP: toctoc_comments-PHP-Sessions are now isolated from other sessions in typo3temp. New TS-Option sessionTimeout allows to fix session life time. Default is 9 hours (540 minutes)
	* PHP: When the session is expired a message is displayed: "Your PHP-Session has expired. Please reload the page"
	* CSS: added the missing line-height for scope-titles depending on theme.boxmodelLineHeight (boxmodell_system.txt)
	* Added TS-Option theme.boxmodelLabelInputPreserve which allows to layout the inputfields and label as in former versions or minimizes the layouting (size and so on), so it's possible to add the CSS classes of toctoc_comments to your custom.css-file (vaild for the design of your site) and change them to your look.
	* Fixed JavaScript Bug "AJAX pagepartrefreshs after AJAX-Logins left over the outerHTML of ids which should be removed." Now the entire tag is removed properly.
	* Fixed comments report form
	* Fixed option theme.boxmodelLabelWidth, added support for boxmodelLabelWidth in the boxmodels
	* Size of Popup-Picures fully depends on attachments.picUploadMaxDimX. This is the maximal width for the image in the popup. With this width some responsive behaviour of the popups are defined.
	* Added support for $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['versionNumberInFilename']
	* Fixed bug in Backendplugin under TYPO3 6.2.0: "External Prefix (and other fields) shows up as mandatory"
		
2014-06-01  Gisèle Wendl  <gisele.wendl@toctoc.ch>
	* Release of version 5.2.0
	* Please change to the new template
	* Changed display of youtube-videos to the new embed-style, which allows videos to be seen also on tablets and handy

	* added support for storagePid in top ratings and recent comments, storagePid can be a single folder or a list of folders

	* fixed bug with unwanted additional "<" at the end of voting on comments and in shortlikes-style (only visible on LINUX systems)
	* fixed bug "approving comments from mail sometimes generated a white page, comments were not approved"
	* In the comments tree when opening collapsed comments from level 3 or deeper, the display of the opened comment box had a problem in display - changed the JavaScript to the correct CSS-values "display: table;" (instead of block)
	* jquery.tools must no longer be included in page.includeJSlibs, the extension now uses the file jquery.toctoc.tools.min.js. jquery.tools.min.js is identical to this file and by compatibility reasons with former 
	    versions the old file is still part of the extension. Furthermore, toctoc_comments checks if jquery.tools.min.js is present in page.includeJSlibs (or includeJS) and then suppresses the link to 
	    jquery.toctoc.tools.min.
	* removed jQuery 1.7 from jquery.toctoc.tools.min.js. This is important for users of jQuery newer than 1.9, the old version jquery.tools.min.js made it impossible to use another jQuery version than 1.7.
	    If you encounter JavaScript errors like "b.browser is not defined", this is because you use jQuery newer 1.9 - the "b.browser error" probably comes from another jQuery-library used than those shipped with toctoc_comments.
	* updated to jQuery.simplemodal 1.4.4.
	* made jQuery.simplemodal and jQuery.tools compatible jQuery >= 1.9 ($.browser was removed in jQuery and needed to be substituted)
	* made jQuery.elastic compatible jQuery 1.7 with newer versions, (border-box CSS style is not token in account by jQuery 1.7.2 and lower)
	* fixed bug (in PHP) "After stand alone login from facebook and if a new userpic was created, user pictures in Plugins on other pages sometimes were missing."
	* when toctoc_comments is run in useSessionCache = 0 now it's made save that the SESSION is reset.

	* Backend-Plugin: storagePid is visible in all plugin-modes now, not only in mode 'normal'- apart from AJAX-Login.
	* TCA: Adjusted range values, some of them were to narrow, resulting in errors on saves in the backend
	* TCA: Some mandatory input fields where missing, for example the description of a rating scope is mandatory now.
	* SEO: Comments and ratings are no longer visible to major search engines with new TS-Option dontSkipSearchEngines = 0
	* PHP-Sessions: No more Session-creation for Search Engines
	* PHP-Sessions: Moved toctoc_comments-Sessions from typo3temp to typo3conf/ext/toctoc_comments/pi1/sessionTemp, this allows better control over session files.
	* Charts: Fixed image-display for tt_content-items on TYPO3 >= 6.0
	* Ratings: Changed data type of average rating fields from int or decimal(19,2) to decimal(19,8), charts on scoped ratings had rounding errors with the former "2 decimal places"-system   
	* Database Update required in TYPO3 4.x

	* Tuned up 1st start of the extension by some 100%. A MySQL-LIMIT created a query with long execution times as soon as 1 of the 2 linked tables became bigger.
	* Fixed bug: AJAX-Login fails with rsaauth enabled in comment-lists
	* Fixed bug: AJAX-Login fails on pages with GET-Parameters containing brackets "[" and "]"
	* Fixed bug: comments browsing fails with advanced.invertBrowser = 0 or advanced.reverseSorting = 0

	* Release of version 6.0.0	
	* Added TypoScript option advanced.commentReviews. When set to 1, then commenting is considered as reviewing: A review is a rating with a comment.
	  Only logged in users can write reviews. Reviews can be commented and rated like normal comments. 
	  At the base reviews comments work like normal comments, but the rules how they are handled are different.

	* ratings.disableIPcheck behaves different now. If disabled, then users can change their votes, subsequent votes are not taken as new votes, but as change of the existing vote
	* With this we added a feature to protect the site from "vote attacks": 3 TypoScript options allow to specify:
	  1. How long the user is prevented from rating once he exceeded the allowed limit (in minutes): ratings.allowedNumberOfRatingsExceededBlocktime = 13
	  2. The number of ratings that can exceed the limit: ratings.allowedNumberOfRatings = 10
	  3. The time to be considered (in minutes): ratings.timeForAllowedNumberOfRatings = 2
	  You can say: If a user made 10 ratings in 2 minutes, then he will be blocked for the next 13 minutes from rating.	  
	* ratings.ratingImageWidth is no longer needed. It's determined now automatically from file toctoc_comments_myrating_star.png in the current themes img directory

	  With this you can fix the page to share to a fixed value. Available in Plugin.
	* The sharing options in TypoScript option section advanced is depreciated. The sharing options are now all in new section sharing. 
	  Existing options under advanced will still work, if they differ from the default value they will be token into account.	
	* In the backend plugin the sharing options have an own section now, section advanced is cleaned out. On updates the old values remain in the plugin, even if one does not see them in the backend. 
	  They are overwritten by new values from section sharing if the new values differ from TypoScript default-setup. 
	* Updated list of the static IP-Block list. (10/17/2014)
	* Revised the boxmodels. Basic logics for the rating stars in now in boxmodel_system.txt and does not need to be touched anymore for different displays of rating stars in user-boxmodels.

	* Added TypoScript-Setup-option requiredMark = *, dropped Subpart ###REQUIRED_FIELD###
	* Fixed JS errors in IE when sorting comments and on comments browse: Background: The tag attributes order in DOM differs from the order in HTML under IE,
      this made fail some JavaScript-functions (split), because the split argument did not match the DOM. example: var.split('<div id="') fails if class attribute is present, 
      because in the DOM the HTML is represented as '<div class="xxx" id="' even if original HTML is like '<div id="'.
	* Fixed missing margin in sharing design 0 and 1s total counter
	* Fixed problem with DB Compare (DROP Index and then ADD Index again for 2 or 3 tables) 
	* Fixed SQL-Error when advanced.showCountCommentViews = 1, no comments present and [SYS][sqlDebug] = 1
	* Fixed tca definition of table tx_toctoccomments_plugincachecontrol, it caused the search of TYPO3 backend to make SQL errors
	* Fixed missing rsa-JS-files when using AJAX-login and a page was opened in loggedin mode, on the page the logout works, but relogin can fail.
	* Fixed problems with editing comments: double space from "show more" is eliminated. Cropped links were not retransformed in full links.

	* New options to control crawlers and blacklisted IPs in section advanced:
	  In addition to the default CrawlerAgents identified by 'googlebot','yahoo','baidu','msnbot','bingbot','spider','bot.htm','yandex','jeevez' we added additional options allowing to define black- or whitelisted crawlers:
      advanced.blacklistCrawlerAgentStrings = AU-MIC,Python,Test,Wotbox, ... (and some more)
      and advanced.whitelistCrawlerAgentStrings = 
      You can log now crawler-accesses to pi1/crawlerprotocol.txt with advanced.protocolCrawlerAgents = 1 (default is 0)
      advanced.protocolCrawlerAgentsMaxLines = 10000 limits the size of the protocol (old entries are dropped after this limit when new entries are written)
      Same protocol ist possible for blacklisted IPs in pi1/blacklistprotocol.txt with advanced.protocolBlacklistedIPs = 1 (default is 0)
      advanced.protocolBlacklistedIPsMaxLines = 10000 limits the size of the protocol
      Now some clients use an empty HTTP_USER_AGENT, this is uncool and they are most possibly crawlers to be excluded from the commenting system and session creation
      For this set advanced.dontTakeEmptyAgentStringAsCrawler = 1 (default is 0)

	* New extension configuration option: Use static IP ban list from Spamhaus.org for website banning using extension toctoccommentssiteban 
	* Added spamProtect.confirmedOptInEmailOnly = 0: Confirmed opt-in (COI) email only:A new commentator receives a confirmation mail needs to confirm his mailaddress by clicking a link, which unhides the comment (not yet approved). Confirmation is valid regardless of IP of the user.
	* Fixed Backendmodule (error on load) for TYPO3 7.0 and newer.
