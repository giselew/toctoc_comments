Use as standalone version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the AJAX login/logout functionality also as stand alone plugin. 

Insert an instance of **toctoc_comments**  on a page and set pluginmode = 5.

**!** As of version 5 it is not yet possible to use the stand-alone on pages where you have
**toctoc_comments**  in plugin-mode 1. Use advanced.loginRequired to make the login 
form available on pages like this.
