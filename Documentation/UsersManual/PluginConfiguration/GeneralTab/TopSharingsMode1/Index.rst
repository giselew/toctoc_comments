Top Sharings mode
"""""""""""""""""

*Deprecated and will be removed in version 9.3
As social platforms like Twitter and Facebook stopped to supply the API-interface to collect sharing totals for users (websites) 
without running an according app we need to stop supply top Sharing reports as well. 
The Top Sharings are based on these totals provided by the social networks, this is no longer given*

In this mode the options of the other tabs are not relevant.

Options for Top Sharings are all set by TS.

**Storage records at page â€“**  you can ignore it for Top Sharings.
