Likes
^^^^^

The design of the Likes started in 2012 and followed the evolution on the social networks, in particular Facebook. 


**Resume:**

1. Until mid 2015: Thumbs were in the classic original design, **thumbs with contours**.
2. Until spring 2016: **Thumbs** became more **graphical**, one color. 
3. Spring 2016: Facebook expanded the Like system by **"reactions"**

This evolution is well visible in the evolution of the design of *toctoc_comments* Like-system as well.

1. Have Thumbs with contours:

::

    theme.themeVersion = 1
    

2. Graphical Thumbs

::

    theme.themeVersion = 2
    

3. emoLikes (like Facebook-reactions)

::

    ratings.emoLike = 1
