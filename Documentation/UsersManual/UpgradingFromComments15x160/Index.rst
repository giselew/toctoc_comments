Upgrading from comments 1.5.x/1.6.0
-----------------------------------

You need to enable the upgrade mode in the
extension setup in Extension Manager.

When upgrade-mode is enabled, the comments
and ratings for comments on a page are imported in *toctoc_comments* regardless of their original
storage folder id.

For importing data data replace the
**comments** plugin by *toctoc_comments*-plugin and open the page. At this moment the data of
this page is imported from the tx_comments-tables to tx_toctoc_comments-tables.


After the update disable the update option again.
