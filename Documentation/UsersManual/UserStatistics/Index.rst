User Statistics
---------------

**User Statistics**  which are maintained by the plugin help to see user activities, and allows to
keep track.

**What is a User in toctoc_comments ?**  

**There are 2 kinds of users: Anonymous and logged in users. *toctoc_comments* stores it's own
user format especially with the goal to identify returning anonymous users.** 

Logged in users, FE-Users, are stored in format '0.0.0.0.fe_userid' (example: 0.0.0.0.2054).

Anonymous users are identified by their IP-address. 
So the
format for anonymous users is 'IP.0' (example: 184.126.45.22.0)
