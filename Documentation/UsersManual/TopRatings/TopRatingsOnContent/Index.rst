Top ratings on content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The links on these items target directly the *toctoc_comments*  plugin on the page holding the
content element.

The image display is on the content element itself, also the texts displayed. TO add an image for
display change the view on the Content element to “Pictures” and add a picture. 

The title and text are from the content element itself. 

To add a text simply copy/paste the content from the content element you target the rating on when
the view on the content element holding the *toctoc_comments*  plugin is changed to “Text”.

Change back to view “Plugin” and save.
