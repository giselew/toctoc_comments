Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The statistics at the base of top ratings are correctly maintained from the moment on you install
*toctoc_comments* . 
Ratings of versions of **toctoc_comments older than 4.0** 
are also considered if you expand the time interval beyond this moment, but it's fuzzy:

The moment when then rating or iLike has been made can't be distinguished. Also
former ratings are only considered after a “new” vote or ilike has been made after install of
version 4.0.
