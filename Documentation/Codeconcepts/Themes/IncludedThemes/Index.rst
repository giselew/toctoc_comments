Included themes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We included a **black**  and **red**  theme as examples for customized themes. Both for sites with
white text, either on black or red, they work well with the default boxmodel.

Themes **windows, koogle, tripad** and **tisqus** are for use with the corresponding boxmodels, but they can be
appied to other boxmodels as well.
