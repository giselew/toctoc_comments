Included themes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We included a **black**  and **red**  theme as examples for customized themes. Both for sites with
white text, either on black or red, they work well with the default boxmodel.

Themes windows, koogle and tisqus are for use with the corresponding boxmodels, but they can be
appied to other boxmodels as well.
