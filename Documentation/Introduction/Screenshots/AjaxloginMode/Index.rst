Facebook- or Google+-accounts

for your website on Google or Facebook and then add the App ID and Secret to *toctoc_comments* 
pi2-TS-Setup

Note on the Captcha for the registration
process: 
It is strongly recommended that you use **sr_freecap** 


Note on preventing abusive user
registrations: 
You can either enable COI or be even more restrictive and require
Administrator Confirmation for new users.


#. COI (confirmed Opt-In) forces new
   fe_users to confirm their e-mail. This does not apply for Facebook or Google+-Accounts, since
   their e-mail is already confirmed to be true.
   
#. Administrator confirmation triggers all
   kinds of new users, Google+ and Facebook account included.
