Normal Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

Commenting, not logged in
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

This is the plugin operating in normal mode. It displays comments, ratings and sharing
options.

Comments can be entered without captcha-check and without approval. The setting without captcha
would typically apply for logged in users.

Note that you can also require Confirmed Opt-in by e-mail when anonymous users comment. Confirmed
Opt-in sends an email to a first time user and asks him to confirm his email.

The following screen-shots show how to make an entry of a comment and then the approval process.

commenting, not logged in, step 1

After posting a comment the 'useCaptcha' option brings the captchas security question.

Here the plugin uses an internal clone of sr_freecap.

After the captcha has been resolved the comment has been recorded in the database.

The user is informed to wait until the moderator (administrator) has approved the
comment.

commenting, not logged in, step 3

The comments administrator receives then an e-mail, he can approve, delete or kill the comment (kill
deletes a comment permanently) from the database.

Commenting with approval by administrator

As the admin clicks on approve comment a web page rendered by the extension is presented. The
template for the page and the HTML-mails can be easily adapted to your needs.
