    :Description:
        AJAX-based commenting, review, rating and sharing system (jQuery) for TYPO3 4.3 to 7.x.
        Comments or reviews can have webpage previews, pictures and pdfs attached. You can use
        BB-Codes, emojis and smilies. Userpictures include gravatar-, Facebook- or
        fe_users-userpictures. More plugin-modes for comments are available, a user center, a recent
        comments list, a report bad comment form and several charts. Four looks for ratings by
        voting stars and Facebook-like iLikes, usage of scopes for categorizing ratings. For ratings
        there is a plugin-mode for top ratings. Many options for spam- and data-protection. AJAX
        runs with jQuery. ViewHelpers for extension news. Comments, reviews or ratings can trigger
        records in other extensions DETAIL-views and LIST-views (LIST-view tt_news, news, modify all
        other pi1-extensions in PHP and implement a new marker or ViewHelper for comments and
        ratings in LIST-views). Includes full featured AJAX Login and Sign Up, including login with
        Facebook or Google+ account. Works with TemplaVoila, tx_news, tt_news, tt_products,
        community, cwt_community and many other extensions. The extension is extremely configurable.
