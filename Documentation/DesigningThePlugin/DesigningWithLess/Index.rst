Designing with LESS-model
-------------------------

.. index::
	single: Design; LESS model

**toctoc_comments** 8.0.0. introduced a LESS model.

.. figure:: /Images/modellingpartsLESS.jpg

The LESS model continues the idea of themes and boxmodels.
 
We have a basic CSS-Model in the LESS-modell, for colors and images we use themes - for the 
customization of the look another LESS-file – the boxmodel – combines into the basic CSS.

[n] = Version of LESS-model

Less-files for boxmodels are present in res/less/toctoc_comments-LESS.[n]/boxmodel

theme.less-files are on the root-level of the themes in res/css/themes


The toctoc_comments LESS model

To edit and review the LESS-modell – including theme.less files and customizations with boxmodels,
I recommend to use Crunch or Crunch 2. `getcrunch.co/
