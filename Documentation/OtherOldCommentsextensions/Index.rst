Other old comments-extensions
=============================

*toctoc_comments* can be used as an
update to extension *comments* .

With *comments* – there are many of
other extensions that implement hooks on *comments* and therefore can't be used
in *toctoc_comments* as they are.

From 18 extensions found 


- 13 are obsolete, their functionality is
  now inside *toctoc_comments* 
- 1 extension can be installed, slightly
  modified and works with *toctoc_comments* 
  
- 4 extensions have not yet been tested or
  the interface in *toctoc_comments*  is not ready for them. The missing
  functionality – overall – reduces to the possibility to use a gravatar as user
  image.
