Hooks
=====

Since the original version of *toctoc_comments* , **comments 1.5.** the extension has not been
tested with all the hooks **comments 1.5.** offered. 

*toctoc_comments*  added AJAX functionality, so many hooks that worked in **comments** don't work
as it in a AJAX environment. 

Also the functions, used by hooks have been moved from class.toctoc_comments_pi1.php to
toctoc_comment_lib.php.

In former versions of this manual we listed all these hooks, but as they have not been tested we
decided to skip this part for instance.
